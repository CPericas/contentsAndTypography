            "As the twenty-first century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, 
            the smartest, the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of 
            man, now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more 
            intelligent. But, as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? 
            Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those 
            who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species."
